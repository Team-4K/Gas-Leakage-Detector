# Gas-Leakage-Detector
During our second semester at University of Moratuwa, we successfully designed a Gas Leakage Detector with an alarm and SMS alert system. Chamod, Tharaka, Kishookkumar, and Kumudu, who contribute to our team, were able to use their knowledge in circuit design, PCB design, enclosure design, and software integration to produce this device.

## Usage ##
- Power on the Gas Leakage Detector.
- The device will continuously monitor the environment for gas leaks.
- If a gas leak is detected, the alarm will sound, and an SMS alert will be sent.

## Components ##
- Gas sensor module
- Microcontroller
- Buzzer
- GSM module for SMS alerts
- Power supply unit
- Custom-designed PCB
- 3D-printed enclosure

## Schemetic Design ##
Our circuit design incorporates the gas sensor module as the input, which is connected to a microcontroller responsible for processing sensor data. The microcontroller triggers the alarm and communicates with the GSM module to send SMS alerts.

## PCB Design ##
We have designed a 2 layer PCB for our device using **Altium** software. The PCB design involved creating a custom circuit board layout that ensures efficient connections and compact arrangement of components. This design minimizes noise interference and facilitates easy assembly.

## Enclosure Design ##
We designed a 3D-printed enclosure useing **Solidworks** software, to house the components securely while allowing proper airflow for accurate gas detection. The enclosure is both functional and visually appealing.

## Software Integration ##
The software integrates the sensor data processing, alarm triggering, and SMS alert mechanism. We used **Arduino IDE** for programming the microcontroller and interfacing with the GSM module.
